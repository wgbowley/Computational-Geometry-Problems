## Computational Geometry Algorithms
**Author:** William Bowley  
**Description:** Implementations of algorithms from *Computational Geometry* by Mark de Berg et al.

This repository contains Python implementations of computational geometry algorithms. They are intended 
for learning and experimentation only, and may serve as a reference for the development of the 3D parametric
geometry module for pyFEA currently ([Blueshark: FEA](https://github.com/wgbowley/BlueShark)) in c++ with Pybind11.
