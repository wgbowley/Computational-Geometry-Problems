## Computational Geometry Algorithms
<b>Author:</b> William Bowley <br>
<b>Description:</b> Implementations of algorithms from Computational Geometry by Mark de Berg et al.

This repository contains Python implementations of classic computational geometry algorithms. It 
serves as both a learning exercise  for ideas that will feed into parametric
geometry module for [Blueshark: FEA](https://github.com/wgbowley/BlueShark)
